To create the burg executable, simply use command "make"
an executable by name burg is created

write input grammer into a file and to generator code generator for it
use command $./burg < input_file_name > outputfilename.cpp

the code required is generated in outputfilename.cpp 

before running it modify the main (for now copy the last few functions from try2.cpp 
                    [all functions below gencode() replace the main of the outputfile with these functions])

and compile and execute it as normal cpp file.
